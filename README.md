YouTube video download script in Python using PyTube module and multi-threading.

List links at "links.txt" file in the main folder and run "main.py".
Script will download the highest resolution file from Progressive Streams or the highest resolution video and audio files from Adaptive Streams each link and save at folder provided by the user.
To change download location update "save_path" variable at "main.py" file.

Future improvements:

YouTube video download script in Python using PyTube module and multi-threading.

List links at "links.txt" file in the main folder and run "main.py".
Script will download the highest resolution file from Progressive Streams from each link and save at folder "D:\Downloads\Videos"
To change download location update "save_path" variable at "main.py" file.

Future improvements:
- Add option to user decide between resolutions
- ~~Add feature for user to choose download and links files location~~
- Add GUI
